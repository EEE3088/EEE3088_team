This projectâ€™s Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) board will consist of two main features, namely: a
temperature and pressure sensor. These sensors will be utilized in a multitude of cases by simply
connecting it to the STM32 PCB board and to a constant power supply, whether portable or fixed.
The multipurpose functionality of the HAT makes it a practical tool for end-users as it is cost-effective
and convenient furthermore it notifies users about environment changes which can prevent mishaps.
